                      <p><b>Architecture of the city | Aldo Rossi (Book Review )</b></p>
                      <p><b>Historical Building</b></p>

                      <p>Monuments are defied by Rossi as primary elements in the city which are persistent and characteristic urban artifact. They are distinguished from housing and other primary elements in the city by their nature as a place of symbolic function and thus a function relates to time, as opposed to a place of conventional function, which is only related to use. Rossi defines primary elements as “those elements which can both retard and accelerate the process of urbanization in a city”. Thus they are catalytic. When a monument retards the process of urbanization, it is considered by Rossi to be “pathological”… At times they may be “propelling.” They serve to bring the past into the present, providing a past that can still be experienced. (p6)</p>
                      <p><b>The Reuse</b></p>

                      <p>I believe that any explanation of urban artifacts in terms of the function must be rejected if the issue is to elucidate their structure and formation. We will later give some examples of important urban artifacts whose function has changed over time or for which a specific function does not exist. Thus, one thesis of this study, in its effort to affirm the value of architecture in analysis of the city, is the denial of the explanation of urban artifacts in terms of function.(p46)</p>

                      <p><b>Time change</b></p>
                      <p>Morphological analysis, one of the most important instrument for studying the city, brings these aspects into full view. Amorphous zones do not exist in the city, or where they do, they are moments of a process of transformation; they represent inconclusive time in the urban dynamic. Where phenomenons of this type appear vey frequently, as in suburbs of the American city, the processes of transformation have usually been accelerated since high density puts greater pressure on land usage. These transformation are realized through the definition of a precise area, and this is when the process of redevelopment occurs.(p95)</p>

                      <p>It is hardly surprising that this concept of context is espoused and applied by those who prefer to preserve the historical cities by retaining their ancient facades or reconstructing them in such a way as to maintain their silhouettes and colors and other such things; but what do we find after these operations when they are actually realized? An empty, repugnant stage. (p123)</p>

                      <p>The complex structure of the city emerges from a discourse whose terms of reference are still somewhat fragmentary. Perhaps the laws of the city are exactly like those that regulate the life and destiny of individual men. Every biography has its own interest, even though it is circumscribed by birth and death. Certainly the architecture of the city, the human thing per excellence, is a physical sign of this biography, beyond the meaning and the feeling with which we recognize it.(p163)</p>

                    <p><b>Charlie Chaplin : Philosophy and Work</b></p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>

                    <p>Charlie Chaplin, one of the greatest figures in cinema, entertained universally for more than 50 years. ‘The Little Tramp’, character associated with Chaplin is synonymous to laughter and entertainment. He was a great entertainer but his movies were not just cinema for fun. They had much more deeper meaning in them. This paper is an attempt to come in terms with this hidden meaning of his cinema and explore his philosophy.</p>

                    <p>This study analyses his three critical masterpieces i.e. ‘Modern Times (1936), The Great Dictator and Monsieur Verdoux- a comedy of murders (1947) to explore his philosophy. Apart from theme of the movie, all relevant scenes from these movies are analyzed to explore various layers of the meaning attached to particular scene. In all selected movies Chaplin has presented a well augmented criticism of issues. His response or critique can be seen as his stand on those issues which can in turn help to weave the structure of his philosophy.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion of this essay on philosophy of Chaplin limits itself to be product of three selected movies. This may seem unfair but I believe these three movies cover major premise of his philosophy and govern major transformations in his life.
                    Key Words: The Tramp, Social Critique, Humanist, Anti-Capitalism</p>

<p><b>Creative Evolution</b></p>
<p><b>An argument on paradigm Shift</b></p>

<p>What is sign of human existence or presence? Sign of human existence or presence are man made artifacts and imposed ‘orders’. Human creates and organize. To organize means to impose an ‘order’. Imposition of ‘order’ on both nature and humanity. Another sign is evolution i.e. To ‘live’ is to ‘evolve’. Evolution is related to creation or evolution in ability to create.This essay does not target any specific field of study but tries to develop a general argument on creative evolution. Study targets factors which makes this creative evolution possible and reasons for current apparent stagnation in creative evolution. One might argue on current bombardment of creations but this essay tries to analyze change in base structure of creative evolution not the quantum of created and corollaries.</p>
<p><b>Framework of study</b></p>
<p>An ‘equation’ is a (primarily mathematical) statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. It tries to understand the relations and develops a possibility where both expressions exist in conciliation. Balance in equations are basic human trait and on them depends our existential pattern. The equations are basic component of the structure of the ‘order’.  ‘Order’ identifies what comes before or after or pre defines the probability of behavior of ‘values’ based on equations. ‘Order’ is most important aspect of civilization and human evolution.Evolution is change or shift of ‘order’. ‘Orders’ arrange themselves to create a ‘system’. ‘System’ is a set of interacting or interdependent ‘orders’ (system components) forming an integrated whole.</p>

<p>‘Systems’ operate on ‘orders’ and equations. These infinite equations define existence.Not every equation is balanced and some time indeterminate equation arise or ‘values’ do not confirm to equations.To exemplify, we can start with very simple equation of division which explains all essential terms and background which will be used in this essay. In equation of division, the dividend is divided by divisor to achieve quotient but when value is not perfectly divisible result comes with ‘remainders’. The behavior of these ‘remainders’ is of prime interest in this essay. Essay uses mathematical terms as tool to exploit multiplicity of meaning.</p>

<p><b>‘Remainders’ and Importance</b></p>
<p>‘Values’ which confirm to the equation are accepted in the ‘system’ but some ‘values’ don’t confirm.The existence of the ‘remainders’ implies that the ‘order’ accepts the value’s  partial behavior but leaves some ‘remainders’ which can’t be accepted in ‘order’. ‘Values’ which confirm to equations completely are rare. Almost every value has a remainder and this contribute to integrated whole of ‘remainders’. These ‘remainders’ also define and redefine ‘system’ and adds to identity of the ‘system’. These ‘remainders’ adds on to instability which overturns its structure or identity time and again to create a new ‘system’. This new system is based on accommodation of ‘remainders’ as ‘values’ instead as ‘remainders’. The simple relation of the ‘remainders’ goes very complex with interaction in various ‘orders’ and ‘systems’. ‘Orders’ exist on  relation of differences. ‘Order’ needs these ‘values’ of difference as an example but at the same time not valuing the differences.  ‘Remainders’ are the agents of the changes and suppressed aspect of the ‘order’. The imposition of the ‘order’ is opposed in ‘remainders’ and these are which do not confirm to the ‘order’ and wish to prove the existence more than just the ‘order’. Certainly this opposition grows from ‘order’ to ‘reminders’ and then vice-versa but in exponential intensities.</p>

<p><b>‘Explorations’ to ‘Exploitation’</b></p>
<p>A new ‘order’ is trying to establish itself.The ‘order’ which is innovative and accommodating difference. One can’t trace a sharp ridge of change in the ‘order’ in every paradigm shift. Some planned revolutions which overturned existing ‘order’ can notice these sharp departures but if one observes these in more broader terms then its almost impossible to trace the exact moments of shift. ‘Remainders’ try to initiate equation which is balanced and accepts it as a value.The sift of the ‘order’ starts with this equation based on an ‘exploration’ which some times contradicts the existing ‘order’ and ‘system’. This exploration grows into an equation of independent existence and some time overturns the complete ‘order’ and structure. This witnesses a rise of a completely radical ‘system’. ‘System’ of a new ‘spirit’ and ‘expression’. The ‘Exploration’ sets up itself as a new ‘order’ and existing ‘values’ are push to margins.The exploration ‘system’ often faces a new set of difficulties which are unprecedented. These difficulties were calculated being in the ‘existing’ ‘system’ but with whole paradigm shift calculations hold untrue. ‘System’ faces difficulties for which ‘exploration’ ‘system’ is not ready. Exploration ‘system’ tries to establishes and evolve but the odds against it also prevail. This new ‘order’ generates more revolutionary ‘remainders’. History repeats itself. When exploration ‘system’ is established, it works as previous ‘system’. It looses degree of exploration and what remains is just ‘system’. The moment which is of prime importance here is when exploration ‘system’ starts exploiting. The existence of harmony is suspended between these moments of exploration to exploitation. The frame of exploration is much less than the exploitation and soon exploitation of exploration prevails.</p>

<p><b>Innovation-differences and Mediation</b></p>
<p>Innovation lies in differences. Difference is most valuable property but throughout history one can trace attempts to exploit and abolish dimension on which differences exist. Contemporary practices appreciate neutralizing of differences and mediating them with averages. Differences should not be mediated. Mediation kills innovation. Limits remain constants and thinking shrinks when caged in limits.Thinking has a task of breaking limits, removing boundaries. Hegelian triad which advocates fusion of the singularity of ‘thesis’ to complexity of ‘antithesis’ for achieving ‘organized complexity’ of synthesis is the base of this mediation. This model is not justifiable to thinking paradigm as it advocates synthesis as a tool of settlement and mediation of difference. Here thesis is a stable proposition challenged by antithesis but most thesis establish them as antithesis. Antithesis comes first to thesis and keeps on evolving and synthesis never happens. Organization of complexity is important aspect of Hegelian synthesis which can be seen as new forced ‘order’ which caters as mid-lending and deems stability.This is a negotiation between existing ‘order’ and emerging ‘order’.  This negotiation is creation of fake realm, just a disguise for identity of ‘orders’. ‘Remainders’ keep evolving and differences never die. Existence of ‘remainders’ is preferable over achieving mediation or resolution of ‘remainders’. Resolved and mediated ‘remainders’ are no ‘remainders’, they loose character. Mediation kills ideas and resolution is not solution but a new problem of compromises. Conflict of ‘orders’ and ideas is desirable and should be accommodated to enrich.</p>

<p><b>Stability of Unstable ‘Systems’</b></p>
<p>From previous arguments it can be assumed that ‘remainders’ are the most important aspect of a ‘order’. Though ‘remainders’ are undesirable for ‘order’ and system but on contrary are catalyst to evolution. ‘Order’ evolves to accommodate the ‘remainders’. If we segregate these ‘remainders’ from the ‘order’ then we will achieve absolutes which makes no progression possible.Evolution of ‘order’ dynamise the ‘system’ hence ‘order’ contributes to identity of the ‘system’. If ‘remainders’ are abolished, ‘order’ freezes, goes monotonous and hence is marginalized in ‘system’</p>
<p><b>Where are ‘remainders’?</b></p>
<p>Its interesting to analyze current states of equations, ‘orders’ and ‘systems’ to question the current sate of ‘remainders’. It seems if equations have gone perfect or system has crashed or ‘remainders’ are extremely marginalized. Perfect equation means accommodation all the variables and relations to create a balanced in equation which satisfies all variable without ‘remainders’. Perfect equation is doubtable as it manifests Utopia and its for sure that its not Utopia. Anarchism is signified by Crash of system, which is also not evident.  Organization and marginalization of ‘remainders’ is important in this discussion as it relates to evolution wheel. This can be studied in following two possibilities</p>
<p><b>Stooged ‘Remainders’:</b></p>
<p>Remainder does not exist separate to ‘value’. Its inside value. Identification of remainders is an issue. If we closely observe the new working paradigms, its quite evident that ‘remainders’ are stooged. ‘Remainders’ exist for sake of being reminders. They just fill in space as essentials in equations and staged as real ‘remainders’. The equations are engineered to produce ‘remainders’ and are controlled by ‘order’. These observations can hold untrue in certain cases but what’s important here is evolution of a new ‘order’ and set of equations which stage a complete paradigm. Here its important to notice that these fake ‘remainders’ confirm organization and structure of the ‘order’ more than variables itself. These ‘remainders’ confirm more to system than ‘absolutes’. As variables and entries which confirm to equation and ‘order’ can improvise to generate some ‘remainders’ but these ‘remainders’ loose there this ability in stooging. These ‘remainders’ are inseparable component of the ‘order’ and deem no evolution. So the ‘remainders’ existing in the ‘order’ are no ‘remainders’ but ‘values’ acting as ‘remainders’.</p>

<p><b>Oppressed Remainders’:</b></p>
<p>Phenomenon of oppression is quite natural. Its inherited in ‘order’ to oppresses ‘remainders’ in every possible means and to retain its identity. This age is facing a unique type of ‘remainders’ and that is ‘remainders of identity crisis’. These ‘remainders’ have no idea about there role in the ‘order’ and responsibility to change course of the ‘order’. Main crisis is not physical oppression but loss of senses and understanding. Current oppression works on duality of body and mind. The mental construct of the ‘values’ and relations has an induced passiveness to ‘remainders’. The ability of mind to oppose is systematically ceased which in turn has handicapped physical actions. The essential condition for upturning of the ‘order’ is physical slavery and mental freedom which is vice versa. ‘orders’ always enjoyed physical superiority of structure to ‘remainders’ (which makes them ‘remainders’) for oppression and has created possibilities for ‘remainders’ to act as ‘values’. These ‘remainders’ have no idea of there existence as ‘remainders’.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>This is age of crisis for ‘order’ and ‘systems’. ‘Systems’ have broken base structure and hope to survive. As discussed earlier, base structure of equation and relations are voided. The ‘remainders’ are mediated, stooged and disguised. Possibility of the evolution is ceased. This is not the first time when ‘systems’ are enjoying this supremacy but this flamboyance will shatter. Change is inevitable and more one resists more is the deviation. The tool for initiation of the chain reaction in ‘remainders’ is ‘doubt’. Crisis is ‘remainders’ have ‘doubt’ of ‘existence’ instead of ‘existence’ of ‘doubt’. Deep down ‘remainder’ exists, ‘doubt’ gives it ‘existence’. Doubt in equation, ‘order’, ‘system’, value, value of value, ‘remainders’, value in ‘remainders’, ‘remainders’ of value and way it exist. Acceptance is confirmation and ‘doubt’ is virtue of evolution.
Start ‘doubting’ and be ‘remainders’.</p>

                    <p><b>INSERTING BUILTFORM IN A HISTORIC URBAN FABRIC</b></p>
                    <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

                    <p>The ideology of the ‘modern’ movement was premised on the cult of ‘newness’ and the purposeful rejection of the past. It equated the avant-garde with the production of architecture and urban spaces to be held in critical esteem and relegated any association with traditional architecture and urban spaces to history. The situation was particularly poignant for the heritage (historic buildings and cities) because the rejection of the past was detrimental to their well being. New ‘modern’ buildings replaced the old very fast. These ‘modern’ buildings generated new urban spaces at the cost of the old traditional tissues.</p>

                    <p>Generating builtform in heritage poses a different set of difficulty and issues for designers, one such example is Chanderi. Chanderi is a fortified city and of historical importance situated in the Ashoknagar district in state of MadhyaPradesh surrounded by hills, lakes and forest. It has several monuments of Bundela  Rajputs and Malwa Sultans. Chanderi is famous for its hand- woven sarees and is a centre for traditional sarees weavers. For a final year design project, we were required to insert an arts and craft institute within the historic fabric and produce an urban environment more sympathetic to the historic context.</p>

                    <p>Solution for my design was derived from understanding of the urban fabric of Chanderi that mostly had meandering medieval streets, gateways, intersected/interrupted with stone monuments, for arts and craft institute I used the above relation of form & space as presented by the city. The heed to urban fabric homogeneity guided in evolving the design to link two parcels of land on either side of the road, backed by contextual values and technology.</p>

                    <p><b>Architecture is expressive. It communicates.</b></p>

                    <p>What is form of this communication and how we understand this communication?</p>

                    <p>Metaphorically, architecture is structured like a language. Loosely, we can compare elements of language with elements of architecture i.e. words, morphology, syntax and semantics. Buildings can be seen as sentences created by these elements based on rules and grammar in architecture.</p>

                    <p>Following linguistic analogy of architecture and centrality of expressiveness. Message of a building can be understood by using linguistic communication model. A building can be seen as utterance or expression and can be unfolded on communication model to understand the message. Jakobson’s communication model can be used as tool for understanding this communication. Emotive, Poetic, Phatic, Metalingual, Referential and Conative functions can be used as tool to understand this message of architectural communication.</p>

                    <p>Intent of the research is to understand language analogy in expressiveness of architecture and develop a tool to understand ‘architectural communication’.</p>

<p><b>Open Prison : Re-Structuring  of social order</b></p>
<p>Society is product of order. To be part of one society, one has to confirm with order of established societies. This is not a one way process and order is not some extraterrestrial entity which is enforced form top down. It is a two way process and always in transition. Even after the transition and dynamics of the order some ‘behaviors’ are not accepted in order. These behaviors, for the greater good of the society, are established as ‘crime’ in human history. Desire to strengthen or protection of this order and search for solution of these critical ‘behaviors’ resulted in complete system of Justice. The biggest image of the canvas of the justice or biggest tool of this order restoration or behavioral correction is ‘Prison’. I have used the word ‘behaviors’ instead of crime deliberately to avoid presumptions related to word ‘crime’. Here behaviors also gives the hint of an optimistic desire of the project for correction.</p>

<p>If we plot these improper behaviors in black spots on white base of ordered society. we will find some what very diverse pattern which shoes the existence of them in all around the society. Prison as an institution concentrates these actors of these behaviors in few locations and  create blots which cages the people responsible for these behaviors.</p>

<p>If we want to create a perfect world, we have these high concentration of actors in few location to deal with. Solving these blots have two major possibilities one is surgical removal of these blots, which is most practiced in history and extremely instinctive or ineffective way of dealing. Michel Foucault outlines this history in Discipline and Punish: Birth of prison, where he proves the inability of punitive measures to deal establishment of order. Other solution which is very new to this dimension is use of ‘behavioral correction’ and re-accommodation in social structure.</p>

<p>Defined in penal system the function of the prison is three fold: custodial, coercive and corrective. So for society role of prison is to confine inmates in certain boundaries, punish them for their acts and correct them to get them readopted in society. Our present prisons work well (though condition of inmates in prison and quality of built environment is questionable) on custodial and coercive part but fail in corrective domain.</p>

<p>Correction can be defined as an institution with predominantly corrective function. Prison is not a place which channels out inmates from real world to make world better place to live  instead serves as buffer between ideal world ie Utopia and real world. Inmates are the capital for this bridge which are always misunderstood. This buffer has a function of reducing the difference between these two domains. Michel Foucault defines these spaces as Heterotopias, in his essay  Of other spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias, he explains .</p>

<p>‘There also exist, and this is probably true for all cultures and all civilizations, real and effective spaces which are outlined in the very institution of society, but which constitute a sort of counter-arrangement, of effectively realized utopia, in which all the real arrangements, all the other real arrangements that can be found within society, are at one and the same time represented, challenged and overturned: a sort of place that lies outside all places and yet is actually localizable. In contrast to the utopias, these places which are absolutely other with respect to all the arrangements that they reflect and of which they speak might be described as Heterotopias.</p>

<p>Utopia in its true nature is metal space, an unrealistic world, perfected, based on our knowledge of immediate real world. In ‘History of Utopias’, Lewis Mumford, provides us a detailed account of idea of utopias which evolved based on prevalent evils of societies at those times. The survey of those works starting from Plato’s ‘Republic’, Thomas More’s ‘Utopia’, Johann Valentin Andreae’s ‘Christianopolis’, Francis Bacon’s ‘The New Atlantis’, Tommaso Campanella’s ‘The city of the sun’ and many others are mental sketches of the highly structured social order. If we compare utopian sketches to Goffman’s ‘Total Institutions’ descriptions, they are not much different. So this will not be wrong to conclude ‘Heterotopias’,effectively realized Utopias, are total institutions.
‘Total institution’ is a key requirement for control and order in these institutions.</p>

<p>As they overlook the complex human diversity, nature, psychology, loose attitude to perfection and inherited inclination to entropy. This is one of reasons that no utopian scheme could ever been realized. Loss of entropy and high structural order is which can only be achieved by ‘loss of freedom’ or in completely controlled environment. Hence there is high possibility of achieving this order in prison as one thing which inmate looses with entering in prison is ‘freedom’.</p>

<p>It was Foucault, who located role of discipline in organization of social space. He analyzed transition of body between these enclosed spaces defined by various ‘discipline’, where individual never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, each having its own laws. In ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control’, Gillies Deleuze, elaborates more on this phenomenon in contemporary societies and analyzes development of these ‘societies of discipline’ to ‘societies of control’. According to Deleuze, virtual control in space and use of electronic cards or access codes redefine the time and space relation of the all the spaces in the city. This is a major theme which also explored by Paul Virilio in his works. This idea of control provides a highly structured space and time configuration to the space uses. This control can also replace power differential which Foucault analyzes as key to success of Panopticon. This project will explore this dimension of the space and time control by overturning the convectional idea of control in prison and using ideas from ‘over exposed city’ and ‘society of control’ in the design. The defined structure of time and space is important factor in ‘total Institutions’ but is redefines and also redefined the idea and possibility of spaces and functions in spaces.</p>

    <p>Manifestation of social theories in architecture comes with confrontation with a harsh reality. Architecture is manifestation of reality and its shaped by its immediate surrounding rather than hyperreal metal phenomenon. Contribution of hyperreal mental concepts can not be denied in architecture but here we are concerned with use in contemporary society.  Architecture has to bridge this gap and create a dialogue between ‘pure real’ and ‘pure mental’ concept. Collin Rowe’s essay ‘Architecture of Utopia’ provides us breakthrough for clues on language of Utopian order. He suggests Utopia to be asA carefully considered artistic theory.</p>
    <p>A fully developed political social and economic structure</p>
    <p>A locus independent of time place and historyConsidering, Foucault’s Heterotopias and Rowe’s Utopia, one can derive the physical manifestation in the language to upturn and present reality in new artistic expression or challenging order. According to many scholars, work of art is something which gives a different view of reality or makes it difficult for us to relate to reality. This architectural language has to overturn the reality and built manifestations have to create an arrangement which challenges the existing notion of art and architecture in precinct.  This idea also has to break a notions attached to prison or utopia.</p>

<p>The Matrix</p>
<p>Matrix is an environment or material in which something develops; a surrounding medium or structure.  This name (as one can guess) is derived from movie matrix. If we see the analogy of the matrix to this project we can compare the organization of mental space. In brief, the movie tries to exploit the classical duality of mind and body. The body is cultivated and mind is set in a coded environment to grow and experience freedom. What is interesting is nature/behavior of mental city and idea of freedom. The city seems similar to Paul Virilio’s ‘overexposed city’. Completely controlled still seems free, random and spontaneous. The way the social space is realized is incredible on dimension of control and this gives us hint to loose the physical control and conversion of real world in to prison just by changing single aspect of reality. Breach in matrix was similar to breach in prison and confrontation with similar analogy.</p>

<p>Plantation of idea of control with physical information devices and use of state of art information technology to realize this control. This way the control remains a mental concept unless physically needed. This also create freedom of movement in the project limits and outside the project limit area based on behavioral improvement. This can also work as motivation for correction. The project limits will be realized as area of most freedom instead of area of control. The model of institution remains as total institution which gives it a freedom from locus of time place and history. But this totalization of institution will be permeable and could be improvised as development of acceptable behaviors which reduces the ridge of inside/outside prison as a merging slope. Drawing the example from a movie, The Shawshank Redemptions(1994), one can understand the shock of so called ‘freedom’ on a person. This can help a person relink to society in a smoother way.</p>

<p>The Project is deemed to serve as an institution in behavioral sciences and will serve as a platform for social debate. The central idea of the project revolves around the possibility of creating an Utopian social structure in side the institution. The physical manifestation of the project, as discussed earlier, is driven from Heterotopic view and Rowe’s idea of creation of new artistic theory. Which will be discussed in detail with description of project.</p>

    <p>A fully developed political social and economic structure</p>
    <p>In this project, we would like to develop an institution which is not imposing and give the possibility to develop a parallel society which can be different from us but at the same time harmonious and can mix in the existing system. Instead of imposing a complete new social and structure, project intends to give the inmates a possibility to organize there community in there way with following instructions-
      Inmates have to device there own laws which define there limits of freedom.
    Inmates have to organize this law as a community and can organize it as they desire.
    The idea of abuses and crimes for community should be predefined and controlled as declared in conception of community.
    The community will have to be self sustainable ie apart from initial organizational support there will be no pool-in of financial support from governing body.

<p><b>Open Prison : Re-Structuring  of social order</b></p>
<p>Society is product of order. To be part of one society, one has to confirm with order of established societies. This is not a one way process and order is not some extraterrestrial entity which is enforced form top down. It is a two way process and always in transition. Even after the transition and dynamics of the order some ‘behaviors’ are not accepted in order. These behaviors, for the greater good of the society, are established as ‘crime’ in human history. Desire to strengthen or protection of this order and search for solution of these critical ‘behaviors’ resulted in complete system of Justice. The biggest image of the canvas of the justice or biggest tool of this order restoration or behavioral correction is ‘Prison’. I have used the word ‘behaviors’ instead of crime deliberately to avoid presumptions related to word ‘crime’. Here behaviors also gives the hint of an optimistic desire of the project for correction.</p>

<p>If we plot these improper behaviors in black spots on white base of ordered society. we will find some what very diverse pattern which shoes the existence of them in all around the society. Prison as an institution concentrates these actors of these behaviors in few locations and  create blots which cages the people responsible for these behaviors.</p>

<p>If we want to create a perfect world, we have these high concentration of actors in few location to deal with. Solving these blots have two major possibilities one is surgical removal of these blots, which is most practiced in history and extremely instinctive or ineffective way of dealing. Michel Foucault outlines this history in Discipline and Punish: Birth of prison, where he proves the inability of punitive measures to deal establishment of order. Other solution which is very new to this dimension is use of ‘behavioral correction’ and re-accommodation in social structure.</p>

<p>Defined in penal system the function of the prison is three fold: custodial, coercive and corrective. So for society role of prison is to confine inmates in certain boundaries, punish them for their acts and correct them to get them readopted in society. Our present prisons work well (though condition of inmates in prison and quality of built environment is questionable) on custodial and coercive part but fail in corrective domain.</p>

<p>Correction can be defined as an institution with predominantly corrective function. Prison is not a place which channels out inmates from real world to make world better place to live  instead serves as buffer between ideal world ie Utopia and real world. Inmates are the capital for this bridge which are always misunderstood. This buffer has a function of reducing the difference between these two domains. Michel Foucault defines these spaces as Heterotopias, in his essay  Of other spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias, he explains .</p>

<p>‘There also exist, and this is probably true for all cultures and all civilizations, real and effective spaces which are outlined in the very institution of society, but which constitute a sort of counter-arrangement, of effectively realized utopia, in which all the real arrangements, all the other real arrangements that can be found within society, are at one and the same time represented, challenged and overturned: a sort of place that lies outside all places and yet is actually localizable. In contrast to the utopias, these places which are absolutely other with respect to all the arrangements that they reflect and of which they speak might be described as Heterotopias.</p>

<p>Utopia in its true nature is metal space, an unrealistic world, perfected, based on our knowledge of immediate real world. In ‘History of Utopias’, Lewis Mumford, provides us a detailed account of idea of utopias which evolved based on prevalent evils of societies at those times. The survey of those works starting from Plato’s ‘Republic’, Thomas More’s ‘Utopia’, Johann Valentin Andreae’s ‘Christianopolis’, Francis Bacon’s ‘The New Atlantis’, Tommaso Campanella’s ‘The city of the sun’ and many others are mental sketches of the highly structured social order. If we compare utopian sketches to Goffman’s ‘Total Institutions’ descriptions, they are not much different. So this will not be wrong to conclude ‘Heterotopias’,effectively realized Utopias, are total institutions.</p>
<p>‘Total institution’ is a key requirement for control and order in these institutions.</p>

<p>As they overlook the complex human diversity, nature, psychology, loose attitude to perfection and inherited inclination to entropy. This is one of reasons that no utopian scheme could ever been realized. Loss of entropy and high structural order is which can only be achieved by ‘loss of freedom’ or in completely controlled environment. Hence there is high possibility of achieving this order in prison as one thing which inmate looses with entering in prison is ‘freedom’.</p>

<p>It was Foucault, who located role of discipline in organization of social space. He analyzed transition of body between these enclosed spaces defined by various ‘discipline’, where individual never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, each having its own laws. In ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control’, Gillies Deleuze, elaborates more on this phenomenon in contemporary societies and analyzes development of these ‘societies of discipline’ to ‘societies of control’. According to Deleuze, virtual control in space and use of electronic cards or access codes redefine the time and space relation of the all the spaces in the city. This is a major theme which also explored by Paul Virilio in his works. This idea of control provides a highly structured space and time configuration to the space uses. This control can also replace power differential which Foucault analyzes as key to success of Panopticon. This project will explore this dimension of the space and time control by overturning the convectional idea of control in prison and using ideas from ‘over exposed city’ and ‘society of control’ in the design. The defined structure of time and space is important factor in ‘total Institutions’ but is redefines and also redefined the idea and possibility of spaces and functions in spaces.</p>

    <p>Manifestation of social theories in architecture comes with confrontation with a harsh reality. Architecture is manifestation of reality and its shaped by its immediate surrounding rather than hyperreal metal phenomenon. Contribution of hyperreal mental concepts can not be denied in architecture but here we are concerned with use in contemporary society.  Architecture has to bridge this gap and create a dialogue between ‘pure real’ and ‘pure mental’ concept. Collin Rowe’s essay ‘Architecture of Utopia’ provides us breakthrough for clues on language of Utopian order. He suggests Utopia to be asA carefully considered artistic theory.
    A fully developed political social and economic structure
    A locus independent of time place and historyConsidering, Foucault’s Heterotopias and Rowe’s Utopia, one can derive the physical manifestation in the language to upturn and present reality in new artistic expression or challenging order. According to many scholars, work of art is something which gives a different view of reality or makes it difficult for us to relate to reality. This architectural language has to overturn the reality and built manifestations have to create an arrangement which challenges the existing notion of art and architecture in precinct.  This idea also has to break a notions attached to prison or utopia.</p>

<p><b>The Matrix</b></p>
<p>Matrix is an environment or material in which something develops; a surrounding medium or structure.  This name (as one can guess) is derived from movie matrix. If we see the analogy of the matrix to this project we can compare the organization of mental space. In brief, the movie tries to exploit the classical duality of mind and body. The body is cultivated and mind is set in a coded environment to grow and experience freedom. What is interesting is nature/behavior of mental city and idea of freedom. The city seems similar to Paul Virilio’s ‘overexposed city’. Completely controlled still seems free, random and spontaneous. The way the social space is realized is incredible on dimension of control and this gives us hint to loose the physical control and conversion of real world in to prison just by changing single aspect of reality. Breach in matrix was similar to breach in prison and confrontation with similar analogy.</p>

<p>Plantation of idea of control with physical information devices and use of state of art information technology to realize this control. This way the control remains a mental concept unless physically needed. This also create freedom of movement in the project limits and outside the project limit area based on behavioral improvement. This can also work as motivation for correction. The project limits will be realized as area of most freedom instead of area of control. The model of institution remains as total institution which gives it a freedom from locus of time place and history. But this totalization of institution will be permeable and could be improvised as development of acceptable behaviors which reduces the ridge of inside/outside prison as a merging slope. Drawing the example from a movie, The Shawshank Redemptions(1994), one can understand the shock of so called ‘freedom’ on a person. This can help a person relink to society in a smoother way.</p>

<p>The Project is deemed to serve as an institution in behavioral sciences and will serve as a platform for social debate. The central idea of the project revolves around the possibility of creating an Utopian social structure in side the institution. The physical manifestation of the project, as discussed earlier, is driven from Heterotopic view and Rowe’s idea of creation of new artistic theory. Which will be discussed in detail with description of project.</p>

    <p>A fully developed political social and economic structure
    In this project, we would like to develop an institution which is not imposing and give the possibility to develop a parallel society which can be different from us but at the same time harmonious and can mix in the existing system. Instead of imposing a complete new social and structure, project intends to give the inmates a possibility to organize there community in there way with following instructions-
      Inmates have to device there own laws which define there limits of freedom.
    Inmates have to organize this law as a community and can organize it as they desire.
    The idea of abuses and crimes for community should be predefined and controlled as declared in conception of community.
    The community will have to be self sustainable ie apart from initial organizational support there will be no pool-in of financial support from governing body.
      State can support skill development programme , if needed and requested.
    There will be possibility of free financial trade between, the matrix and outside world. With limitation of certain trades like firearms etc.
    There is a fear of development of completely new and radical social organization but this will be devised and intervened wherever need for common good.</p>
