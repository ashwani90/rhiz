                  Rhizome is a continuously growing horizontal underground stem structured in complex interconnections, which lead to a rich concentration of qualities in the plant. Deleuze & Guattari explored this idea in contrast to the Arborescent structure of knowledge. A model which is not reclusive but inclusive in nature and borrows knowledge from seemingly different domains. This gives the possibility of percolation and connections from various knowledge systems and delivers a new whole which is richer and more fascinating.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Architecture is not really a domain of ‘itself’ but ‘reflections’. It signifies or is vehicle of meaning for knowledge beyond itself and in our approach architecture is the rhizome of techno-socio-philosophical ideas. In Deleuze & Guattari’s view rhizome is characterized by “ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles”. Rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The rhizome is reducible to neither the one or the multiple. It is always in middle (milieu) from which it grows and which it overspills.”
              </p>
              <p>
                  We take clues from what is around, and directly or indirectly influences architecture and we make it a stakeholder in the design process to achieve a distinctive result. More than a design philosophy – it’s a thinking methodology to fuse a simple idea with derivatives and influences which lead to uncharted territories.

                  Architecture, as we see, is a theatre for performance of life. Our quest is to create a medium which offers possibilities and can add to meaning. We try to develop projects which can achieve a delicate balance of theory and practice in architecture. We started our journey with testing theoretical concepts in developing architecture which lead to fascinating effects on our idea of practice and vice-versa. This ever-evolving balance of theory and practice is the soul of the practice and leads to commendable projects.

              <p>
                  We challenge not just the idea of design but our notions, and like to design beyond our comfort zone and hence are able to deliver projects of diversity and appeal.  Our highly collaborative, research base design method involves clients, stakeholders and experts from a wide range of fields in the creative process. Hence the results are exemplary, outstanding projects.

                  Every century had its form of struggle and I believe this century will be defined by our struggle for equality and information. The world is still not flat and it’s a mammoth task to develop conditions of equal opportunities across the globe. With alarming rise in population and limitation of resources, providing good quality of Habitat and Health facilities are two major areas of focus for developing world. Rhizome Group works in both domains of prime importance and working towards changing the way we think about Built Environment Design and Healthcare.
                  Identification of problem is first half of solution. Precise problem identification can only be powered by everchanging techno-scientific universe of innovation which needs to be plugged in to our grassroot reality. Rhizome Care is an ecosystem which facilitates penetration of these innovations to grassroot level.
              </p>
              <p>
